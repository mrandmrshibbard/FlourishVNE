 ✨ What Makes Flourish Special?

 🎭 Advanced Layered Character System
Unlike other VN engines that limit you to static character sprites, Flourish uses a revolutionary layer-based system:
- Create characters with unlimited expressions (happy, sad, angry, surprised, custom emotions)
- Build characters from multiple PNG layers (base body, eyes, mouth, accessories, etc.)
- Mix and match layers to create thousands of unique expression combinations
- Each expression can use different layer assets for maximum flexibility
- Perfect for complex character emotions and customization

 🎬 Visual Command Editor
Build your story with a drag-and-drop command system - no scripting required:
- 30+ command types including dialogue, choices, jumps, variables, and screen effects
- Real-time preview shows exactly how your scene will look
- Drag commands to reorder, duplicate with one click
- Color-coded branches organize complex story paths visually
- Conditional execution - commands only run when conditions are met

 🎨 Custom UI Builder
Design every aspect of your game's interface with a visual UI editor:
- Create title screens, pause menus, settings screens, save/load interfaces
- Add buttons, text, images, sliders, toggles, and save slot grids
- Position elements with precision using percentage-based layouts
- Support for custom images and videos as UI backgrounds and button states
- Build interactive HUDs with dynamic variable displays

 🔀 Powerful Branching & Variables
Create complex, reactive stories that remember player choices:
- Variables system: numbers, strings, booleans with default values
- Math operations: add, subtract, random ranges for stats and RNG mechanics
- Conditional branching: 8 operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=, contains, startsWith)
- Dynamic text interpolation: show variables in dialogue with {variableName} syntax
- Choice consequences: set variables, jump to scenes, or chain multiple actions
- Scene-level conditions: entire scenes can require conditions to be accessible
- Fallback scenes: automatic redirects when conditions aren't met

 💾 Professional Save/Load System
Built-in save management that works automatically:
- Multiple save slots with thumbnail previews
- Timestamp and scene name for each save
- Saves persist between sessions using localStorage
- Export/import save files for sharing or backup
- Works in both the editor (for testing) and exported games

 🎵 Complete Audio & Video Support
Bring your story to life with rich multimedia:
- Background music with crossfading and per-track volume control
- Sound effects with automatic mixing and overlap prevention
- Video backgrounds for animated scenes and cinematics
- Video character sprites for animated characters (supports loop settings)
- Full-screen video cutscenes with automatic progression
- Supports MP3, OGG, MP4, and WebM formats

 📦 One-Click Export to Standalone Games
Export your entire game as a single HTML file that runs anywhere:
- No server required - works offline after download
- All assets embedded - backgrounds, characters, audio bundled in
- Cross-platform - runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, mobile browsers
- Zero dependencies - players don't need to install anything
- Standalone playback - includes a complete game engine
- Perfect for itch.io, Game Jolt, personal websites, or offline distribution
